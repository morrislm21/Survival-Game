# Survival Game
 Simple game where you try to survive as long as you can on screen.

# Play
To run, download the code and run the survival_game.py file. From here the game will boot up automatically and run until the player is hit by a missile.

# Future
Add simple start screen, score counter, and a game over screen. Score counter would be either on placed collectibles or time survived (or a combination).
